# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project performs "Sentiment Analysis" on tweets to classify them as "positive","negative", or "neutral". The analysis is done using ""Natural Language Processing (NLP)"" techniques and Machine Learning models.

## Features
- Preprocessing of raw Twitter data (removing stopwords, URLs, mentions, etc.)
- Sentiment classification using machine learning algorithms
- Data visualization for sentiment distribution
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset consists of tweets collected from ""Twitter API""or publicly available datasets. It includes labeled sentiments ("positive, negative, neutral").

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open and execute the notebook step by step.

## Results
- The model predicts sentiment with high accuracy.
- Visualizations show the sentiment distribution among tweets.
